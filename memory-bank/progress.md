# Progress

## What Works / Completed

*   **Initial Project Understanding:**
    *   The `步骤.txt` file, outlining the steps to create an "entity-name" feature module, has been reviewed.
    *   The existing project structure (including `templates/` and Python codegen scripts) has been noted.
*   **Memory Bank Initialization:**
    *   `projectbrief.md` created.
    *   `productContext.md` created.
    *   `systemPatterns.md` created.
    *   `techContext.md` created.
    *   `activeContext.md` created.
    *   This `progress.md` file is currently being created.

## What's Left to Build / To-Do

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Initialization:** All core memory bank files have been created for this session.
2.  **Clarify "Database Sourcing" for Templates (Crucial):**
    *   Understand precisely how "database" information (entity names, field definitions, types, etc.) is used by the Python scripts (`codegenF.py`, `db_utils.py`, `entity.py`) to populate/generate code from Jinja templates. This will directly impact how the Jinja templates are structured and validated.
    *   This might require inspecting the Python scripts or asking the user for clarification before running the generation.
3.  **Jinja Templates for "entity-name" Feature Created:**
    *   All primary Jinja templates for the `entity-name` feature module (based on `步骤.txt` and existing template structure) have been created under `templates/src/features/{{ entity_name_slug }}/`. This includes:
        *   `index.jinja`
        *   `context/{{ entity_name_slug }}-context.jinja`
        *   `data/schema.jinja`
        *   `data/{{ entity_name_slug }}-data.jinja` (for filter options, etc.)
        *   `data/{{ entity_name_slug }}.jinja` (for mock data)
        *   `components/columns.jinja`
        *   `components/data-table.jinja`
        *   `components/data-table-row-actions.jinja`
        *   `components/{{ entity_name_slug }}-data-table-toolbar.jinja`
        *   `components/{{ entity_name_slug }}-dialogs.jinja`
        *   `components/{{ entity_name_slug }}-mutate-drawer.jinja`
        *   `components/{{ entity_name_slug }}-primary-buttons.jinja`
    *   Placeholders and Jinja variables have been used to make these templates dynamic.
4.  **Verify Template Structure and Variables:** Ensure the created Jinja templates and the variables used within them align with the expectations and capabilities of the Python code generation scripts. This is tightly coupled with clarifying "Database Sourcing".
5.  **Address Routing and Navigation Updates:**
    *   The updates to `src/routeTree.gen.ts` and `src/components/layout/sidebar-data.tsx` (as specified in `步骤.txt`) are typically handled by the Python code generation script after rendering the main templates. These modifications involve targeted code insertions rather than full file templating. The Python script will need logic to parse these files and add the new route/navigation item.
6.  **Code Generation and Testing:**
    *   Run the Python code generation script (e.g., `python codegenF.py --entity {{entity_name_slug}}`) to generate the actual `.tsx` files from these Jinja templates.
    *   After generation, lint, format, build, and test the new feature module as per `步骤.txt`.

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Template Creation.
*   **Current Action:** All Jinja templates for the `entity-name` feature module have been created.
*   **Next Immediate Action:** Proceed with clarifying "Database Sourcing" and then run the Python code generation scripts to produce the final TypeScript files.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   **Ambiguity in "Database Sourcing":** The exact mechanism of how database information feeds into the Jinja templates via the Python scripts is not yet fully clear. This is a potential blocker for creating accurate and effective templates. I will proceed with creating generic templates and will ask for clarification if I hit a roadblock.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Decision:** Create all core memory bank files before starting the main task.
*   **Decision:** The primary task is to create Jinja templates, not raw `.tsx` files, based on the user's request and the project's existing structure.
