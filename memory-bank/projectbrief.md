# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

This project is a web application designed for managing various data entities. The primary goal is to provide a structured and user-friendly interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) these entities.

The application follows a modular design, where each entity type is managed within its own feature module. This allows for clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

The current task is to implement a new feature module for managing an entity referred to as "entity-name", following a predefined set of steps and code structures.

## Key Features (General)

*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Dashboard for an overview of entities.
*   Individual management pages for each entity type.
*   Data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination.
*   Forms for creating and editing entities with validation.
*   Dialogs for confirmations and additional actions (e.g., import, delete).
*   Responsive design for usability across different devices.
*   Theming capabilities (e.g., light/dark mode).

## Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of the frontend application. Backend services and database interactions are assumed to be handled separately or are pre-existing, with the frontend interacting via APIs (though specific API integration details are not fully outlined in the initial context).

The immediate scope is to add the "entity-name" feature module as per the specifications in `步骤.txt`.
