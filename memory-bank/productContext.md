# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project exists to streamline the management of various data entities within an organization or for a specific application. Traditional methods of data management (e.g., spreadsheets, disparate tools) can be inefficient, error-prone, and lack a centralized view. This application aims to provide a modern, web-based solution to these challenges.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Data Silos:** Consolidates entity management into a single platform, breaking down data silos.
*   **Inefficiency:** Automates and simplifies common CRUD operations, saving time and effort.
*   **Data Inconsistency:** Enforces data validation rules (e.g., via Zod schemas) to improve data quality and consistency.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Provides clear and organized views of data through tables and dashboards.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Offers a user-friendly interface designed for ease of use, contrasting with potentially clunky or overly complex existing systems.
*   **Scalability:** Modular design allows for the easy addition of new entity types as the application's scope grows.

## How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should be able to easily find and navigate to the sections for managing different entities.
*   **Clear Data Presentation:** Data tables should be easy to read, understand, and interact with (sorting, filtering).
*   **Efficient Data Entry:** Forms for creating and editing entities should be straightforward, with clear instructions and helpful error messages.
*   **Responsive and Performant:** The application should load quickly and respond smoothly to user interactions, adapting well to different screen sizes.
*   **Consistent UI/UX:** A consistent design language and interaction patterns should be used throughout the application to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Feedback:** The system should provide clear feedback to users for their actions (e.g., success messages, loading indicators, error notifications).
*   **Accessibility:** The application should strive to meet accessibility standards to be usable by a wide range of users.
